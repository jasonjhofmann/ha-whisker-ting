## Sensors

| Sensor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Current voltage | Real-time voltage reading (WebSocket) |
| Voltage high | Peak high voltage |
| Voltage low | Peak low voltage |
| Hazard status | Overall hazard status (no_hazards, hazard_detected, learning) |
| EFH status | Electrical Fire Hazard status |
| UFH status | Utility Fire Hazard status |

## Binary Sensors

| Sensor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Fire hazard | On when any fire hazard is detected |
| Learning mode | On when the device is in learning mode |

## Requirements

- Home Assistant 2024.1.0 or newer
- Whisker Labs Ting device
- Whisker Labs account

## Troubleshooting

### Voltage shows "Unknown" briefly on startup

This is normal - the integration waits for the WebSocket connection to receive its first data packet before displaying values.

### Authentication errors

Ensure you're using the same email and password you use in the Whisker Labs mobile app.
